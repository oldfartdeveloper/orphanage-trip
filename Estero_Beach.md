    reduce your time to cross the border when you return.
    
It is a beautiful place.  Walk around a bit; find your room and then go to
the restaurant where the "old-timers" will be waiting to greet you.

# Return Trip for Fast Pass Holders


## Fast Border Return

If you stayed Saturday night at **Estero Beach Resort** or ate at
a nice Mexican restaurant, be sure to ask for a "fast pass" certificate.
You can use this to cut your
border crossing time from >3 hours to maybe 45 minutes; well worth it.

Be sure to carefully follow the driving recommendations suggested in the
certificate; it can be tricky to navigate if you don't.
Talk w/ members of the group who have used **Fast Pass**; they will
have suggestions for making sure you use the correct route.

This guide is what I've used.

## Using Google Maps Directly

1.  They take you from the Estero Beach Hotel's parking lot exit to the **fast pass**
    gate in Tijuana.
1.  The recommended route is exactly the one I have taken; it's worked for me.
1.  It is a lot easier than following the directions below.

## Drive to the US Border

Here goes:

1.  Exit the **Estero Beach Resort** by driving out past the guard gate.
1.  Turn right onto **Av. L치zaro C치rdenas**.
1.  Left at the signal (**Highway 1**).
1.  Drive **straight** up **Highway 1** for **4.0 miles**.

    ![Av Dr Pedro Loyola street](bear_left_at_av_dr_Pedro_loyola.jpg)
1.  Turn right at the next cross street onto **Highway 3**. *Note it is probably not
    marked*:<br/>
    ![Bear Right onto Hwy 3](bear_right_turn_on_highway_3.jpg)
1.  Stay on **Highway 3** as it goes through the Ensenada seaport and then runs along
    the beach.  You will several miles until you reach a tiny freeway intersection.

    ![Choose Tijuana over Tecate](tijuana_exit_out_of_ensenada.jpg)
1.  Drive until you come to a fork where you choose to drive the scenic **toll** road
    or the free **libre** road.  Bear **left** onto the scenic toll road:<br/>
    ![Choose scenic road](choose_scenic_rd.jpg)
1.  You will arrive at the first toll booth.  Pay and proceed.

> Enjoy the scenic road.  When you are past the last **(3rd)** toll booth, it will be
> time to pay attention to the driving instructions again.

1.  After the last toll booth, in a
    few miles you will notice you are climbing up a hill next to the **US
    border fence**:<br/>
    ![Border Fence](border_fence.jpg)

    As you come down, watch for the **San Diego** offramp:<br/>
    ![San Diego Exit](san_diego_cloverleaf.jpg)
1.  You will go up a steep hill again, and then notice you are driving parallel
    to the **US border** (again):<br/>
    ![Border Wall](border_wall.jpg)

    highway starts curving to the right:<br/>
    ![Highway turns right](road_bears_right.jpg)

    sign:<br/>
    ![Smart & Final Sign](watch_for_smart_and_final_sign.jpg)
1.  Turn **left** at the **first signal**:<br/>
    ![left signal](left_turn_at_signal_for_fast_pass.jpg)   
1.  *Important!:* You will quickly encounter 5 signs and 3 roads to choose from.  Just
    take the middle one (**Col. Federal**):<br/>
    ![Fast Pass Entrance](fast_pass_entrance.jpg)
1.  You will make a long 360 degree circling up onto a bridge.  Keep
    going until you can bear left to a gate as shown here:<br/>
    ![Fast Pass Gate](fast_pass_gate.jpg)
1.  There an official will process your **fast pass**.  It if passes muster,
    he will open the gate for you, and your wait to cross the border
    will be cut by around 70% (or more).
    
Enjoy the goings-on as you wait to cross the border.  Be sure you have your
**passports** ready to hand over to the border agents.

*Merry Christmas!  See you next year.*
