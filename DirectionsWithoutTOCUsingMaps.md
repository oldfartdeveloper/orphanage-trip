# 2022 Orphanage Trip Driving Instructions

## Before We Start

You have chosen the document that assumes you want to use **Google Maps** or **Apple Maps**.  This is the same as the other document except that the detailed turn-by-turn navigation is not included since the map app does it so much better.

However, we will include some turn-by-turn while we're going through Mexico's entry border so that can meet at the desired customs location.

### Alternatives for Using these Instructions

These instructions can be accessed in the following ways:

* As the web page you are reading now.  If you don't have to worry about roaming charges,
  you can simply leave this page open.
* As a paper handout; see Dianne.
* As a PDF file in your smart phone or tablet.  The iPhone, for one, has *iBooks* which
can hold a PDF file in your smart phone's memory and access it.  Once loaded,
you don't have to have a live Internet connection.  **You can get the
PDF from Scott.**

### Things You Need

1. **Does everyone in your party have a passport?  If not, now is a good time to go retrieve it!**
1. **Do you have $12 for tolls charged by the Ensenada Scenic Highway?  $12 covers the cost in both directions.**
1. **Be sure to buy Mexican insurance *online* before meeting up with the group on Saturday.** Most people in our group buy it from Auto Club.  It is highly recommended that you do not enter Mexico w/o Mexican insurance; if you are in an accident, it is likely that the Mexican authorities will not release you through the border until claims are solved.

## Driving Instructions to Orphanage from Dianne's House

### Overview

1. Starts from Dianne's house.
1. Ends at the orphanange in Ensenada.

Here's an overview map of the trip:

![overview map](Orphanage_overview.jpg)

You can see that I've broken this into two stretches:

* From Dianne's to almost the Border (**McDonalds**) at **707 W San Ysidro Blvd, San Ysidro**.
* The drive in **México** to the **orphanage**.

### Instructions to the Stop Before the Border - McDonalds/Mexican Insurance

| **Starting point**                                              | **End Point**                                      |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| Dianne Lundquist's house, 5141 Chateau Circle, Irvine, CA 92604 | McDonalds at **707 W San Ysidro Blvd, San Ysidro** |

So enter **707 W San Ysidro Blvd, San Ysidro** into your map program and proceed.

Upon arriving, you will see other members of the team parked in McDonald's parking lot.

Considerations:

1. Breakfast: **McDonalds**, **Carl's Jr**, or **Coco's**.
1. Restroom break: any of the above.
1. Buy gas (**Arco**) if you don't have enough to get back w/o filling up.  I've filled up
    in Ensenada, and I didn't observe any adverse effects to my car, but if you're worried
    about it, buy gas here.
1. Also, have about $12 available for tolls on the beautiful Ensenada Scenic Road.
    They take US dollars.  Checkout **B of A ATM** if you forgot.

### Crossing the Border

If you haven't driven in México before

1. People drive much slower in México.  Unlike the United States where we try
    to make the roads as safe as possible (and drivers get so bored they talk
    on their cellphones and cause accidents), roads in México are more primitive
    and you HAVE to pay attention (which is a GOOD thing).  Fortunately, we're
    driving in daytime, and the landmarks you need to see are not hard to spot.
1. Drivers are courteous in México; be courteous to them.  I see much less
    reckless driving in México than in the states.

We're going to stop for customs as a group first

We'll drive across the border following the orphanage's red and white van and, in a hundred feet or so, will pull
into a parking area and stop.

1. ***We will go over as a group because Mexican customs wants to see us as a group.
    Don't go off on your own yet!***
1. ***Important:*** **Follow the nuns' instructions here.  They have a plan to get
    us in and out of Mexican customs quickly.**

### Starting the Border Crossing - Inspection (Customs)

We're not using the map app at this point because we're travelling as a group:

1. Follow the nuns' van to the Mexican border.
1. Start going through the **border**:
    ![intl_border_800_ft](intl_border_800_ft.jpg)
1. Use **autos only** lanes:
    ![auto only](autos_only.jpg)
1. Make a **sharp right** turn:
    ![sharp right turn](sharp_right.jpg)
1. Move over into the **right langes** to be ready for the **Playas** turn off:
    ![follow_playas_sign](follow_playas_sign.jpg).
1. The van will pull over to a large open area to the right of the **sharp left** curve in the road.  ***Follow the van***.  The
    van will pull into a structure designated for travelers having something to declare.  Pull into a parking
    spot in the structure and turn off your engine.

### While in the structure

You can walk around, visit (kibbutz).  Inside the building they have plenty of public restrooms.
At some point, a customs inspector will ask to see the contents of your car; go ahead and help them do so.

Eventually, everyone will again line up behind the van and again follow it into the next facility which
is the customs area.
So you will quickly park in a new spot.
This won't take long at all; basically customs will inspect the cars missed at the previous
facility.

At the end of this phase, you are free to travel on your own to the orphanage.
You can follow the van if you want, but you are not
"required to".  These instructions should be sufficient to guide you the rest of the way.

## Driving the Mexican Portion

Enter the orphanage's address, **Avenida Hildago 787, Ensenada** into your map app and follow its directions. Be sure you have **enabled toll roads and chosen the toll route**;  otherwise the free roads will take you on quite an adventure.

When you arrive, the orphanage will be on your right and will look like this:

![orphanage](orphanage.jpg)

The **black metal gate** will be open and you can drive into the courtyard.

The orphanage address is

```text
Colegio Guadalupe Victoria
Av Hidalgo 787, Obrera
22830 Ensenada
B.C., Mexico
```

*Congratulations, you have arrived!*

## Are You Staying at the Estero Beach Resort

Reasons to Do So

1. Beautiful night stay at a reasonable rate.
1. Excellent on-premises restaurant.
    * Even though the nuns feed us lunch and dinner, it's fun to get together for a meal with the others.
    * The same restaurant offers an outdoor Sunday brunch right on the beach/bay.
      I consider this the highlight of the trip; if you haven't done this,
      consider sitting watching the waves and the pelicans in the warm sun with a hot cup of
      coffee in your hands to be a *mandatory* bucket list event.
1. As important as the above are, an even more important reason is that you get
    a **Fast Pass** certificate.  This enables
    you to cross the border going back in a small fraction of the time you would otherwise take.
    Last year it only took 20 minutes from when we arrived at the gate where
    they process the certificate to when we
    drove past the border agent and were driving on US highways again.
    Without the pass, it will take hours to get across.

## Driving Instructions from Orphanage to Estero Beach Resort

Use your map app to navigate to the following address:

```text
Estero Beach
22785 Ensenada
Baja California, Mexico
```

After arranging your visit, the staff will direct you to your room.  Be sure to inquire about acquiring a **Fast Pass** that will substantially reduce your time to cross the border when you return.

It is a beautiful place.  Walk around a bit; find your room and then go to
the restaurant where the "old-timers" will be waiting to greet you.

## Return Trip for Fast Pass Holders

Be sure to ask for a "fast pass" certificate when you check out.
You can use this to cut your
border crossing time by 50% or more; well worth it.

Here're the instructions for reaching the "fast pass" gate in Tijuana:
[http://www.discoverbaja.com/wp-content/uploads/San-Ysidro-FAST-PASS-directions.pdf](http://www.discoverbaja.com/wp-content/uploads/San-Ysidro-FAST-PASS-directions.pdf).  They presume you are already on the toll road back to Tijuana.

You can also use the instructions available on the "fast pass" certificate that the Estero Hotel front desk gave you when you checked out.

At the gate, surrender your **certificate**; the gatekeeper will open the gate. After going through, enjoy the goings-on as you wait to cross the border.  Be sure you have your
**passports** ready to hand over to the US border agents.

*Merry Christmas!  See you next year.*
